## Steps to Build and Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vedavyaas/Vsprout
```
### 2. Open the Project in Your IDE
Launch Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA.
Click on "Open Folder" or "Open", and navigate to the cloned Vsprout directory.
Wait for the IDE to load and index the project files.
If prompted, import the Maven or Gradle project structure.
### 3. Compile and Run the Backend
In the IDE, navigate to:
```bash
src/main/java/com/Vsprout/Sprout/ConsoleController.java
```
Right-click on ConsoleController.java and select Run,
or run the main class (e.g., VsproutApplication.java) if available.
### 4. Launch the Frontend IDE
Navigate to the frontend folder:
Frontend-Vsprout/index.html
You can either:
Open the file directly in your browser, or
Use a live server (like the Live Server extension in VS Code)
to host it locally.
Then go to:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5500/Frontend-Vsprout/index.html
```
You should now see the Vsprout Online IDE interface.
